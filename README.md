# Reddit Scraper and Sentiment Analysis

### Pull data from Reddit and run sentiment analysis or other analysis. 


## You will need to create your Reddit developer credentials to use this script. 

You can go to https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api/ for detailed instructions on how to create these keys. 


### I will also be updating the data file on this repo. You can avoid the scraping process if you don't care about the timeliness of the data and use this data that has already been scraped. 
#### The NASDAQ stock list is here as well. You will see how I use that down in the notebook where we search for ticker mentions in the Reddit posts.
